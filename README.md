# Crack

"A programmed coded in C to crack accounts."

## The idea :
##-----------

There is a fictitious database with accounts (email address + password) and the program must look for account by account (email address + corresponding password by email address + corresponding password) to verify with in data hard written in the code if the email address and the password match. If so, in the console, next to these email addresses and passwords, there will be marked true, otherwise it will be marked false
